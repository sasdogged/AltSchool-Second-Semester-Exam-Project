# Todo / Task Manager App 📝

Simple todo /task manager app built with HTML, vanilla CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
I built this as a replica to a ReactJS application that we were assigned to build for our second semester AltSchool Examination, I am not yet comfortable building with ReactJS so i decided to build this to use as a foundation for the exam.
